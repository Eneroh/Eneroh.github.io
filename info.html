					<br><br><br><h2>Welcome!</h2><br><br>
					<p>Hi, I'm the creator of <a>Snopoint.xyz</a>.</p>
					<br><p>I am fond of technology and that is why I have undertaken this project
					to host numerous services that will benefit myself and those interested.</p>
					<br><p>The purposes of this website are as follows:</p><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Improve my knowledge in linux server administration,
						website & service hosting, as well as web development
						</li>
						<li>Gather my thoughts and ideas in an organised manner
						</li>
						<li>Act as the central domain or "splashpage" for my
						numerous subdomains
						</li>
						<li>Display information on projects I have planned
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					<p><h2>History of Snopoint</h2></p><br>
					<p>The name <a>Snopoint</a> originates from Snowpoint City located in 
					Pokemon. The name sounded
					interesting and to avoid copyright, I dropped a letter. 
					Thus <a>Snopoint</a> was born.
					I use this name regularly and now it has become the name of my domain
					and website.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Drafts for the <a>Snopoint</a> website begun in 2018. 
					As a long running project, work has
					been placed into the design in snippets. However due to 
					recent events... My workload has been
					simplified, allowing me to work on <a>Snopoint</a> frequently.</p>
					<br><br>
					<p><h2>History of Myself</h2></p><br>
					<p>I am a studied technology enthusiast that enjoys assisting 
					others with their computer-related issues, working with servers, web design and coding.
					I am primarily a linux user but my studies revolved around the Microsoft Windows
					ecosystem. A terminal is where I spend most of my time when I'm not 
					gaming, consuming other forms of media, working on projects, studying, sleeping or 
					socialising (rather difficult now though heh).
					<br><br>
					<p>Thanks for showing interest in my website (:</p>
